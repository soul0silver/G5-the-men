                    <p style="font-style: italic;">"Hair loss is an obsession of every woman, causing troubles in life"</p>
                 </div>
                 <div>
                    <p>Anyone can experience severe hair loss, male or female. Common causes are due to: advanced age, genetic factors, prolonged stress, hormonal disorders, nutritional deficiencies, etc.
                    More seriously, in many cases hair loss is also a sign of disease. Early recognition and treatment will help patients prevent dangerous complications.
                    Some of the common conditions that cause hair loss in men and women include:</p>
                <h5>Fungal scalp</h5>
                    <p>Tinea capitis is a fungal infection of the scalp that leads to itching, flaking, mass hair loss, and even loss of patches</p>
                <h5>Seborrheic dermatitis</h5>
                    <p>Seborrheic dermatitis is a common cause of hair loss. The disease can stem from local factors, parasitic fungi on the skin, stress or the effect of taking drugs.
                    Seborrheic dermatitis causes hair loss in both children and adults. The hair follicles of the infected person will gradually weaken, become brittle, dry and break 
                    easily. The more active the sebaceous glands in the scalp, the more severe the hair loss.</p>
                <h5>Lupus disease</h5>
                   <p>What is a lot of hair loss? This is a fairly typical symptom of people with lupus. Hair loss often occurs in the forehead area when the patient washes and combs the hair.
                     The reason is that the hair is dry and brittle, so it is easy to break.
                    In addition to hair loss, people with Lupus also experience many other problems such as: muscle pain, joint pain, mouth ulcers, light sensitivity, chest pain, blood in the urine, seizures, etc.</p>
                <h5>Hypothyroidism</h5>
                   <p>Thyroid hormone plays an important role in metabolism, promoting the growth of the body. If thyroid function declines, not only will the patient's health be affected,
                     but the hair follicles will also become weaker and more prone to breakage.
                    To recognize hypothyroidism early, you can rely on the following signs: Fatigue, shortness of breath, nervousness, heart palpitations...</p>

                <h3>Graying</h3>
                <div class="imagesP">

                    <p style="font-style: italic;">"The problem of premature graying of hair is becoming more and more common"</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>Premature gray hair is a condition that can occur when the body has stopped producing melanin. Or it could be that the albumin functions have been disrupted, causing the hair to turn silver. In addition,
                         the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in the hair also destroys these melanin pigments and causes the hair to turn gray sooner.</p>
                    <p>With so many harmful factors from today's living environment, the problem of premature graying hair is becoming more and more common. So, what are the reasons why we are prone to this problem?</p>
                    <h5>1. There is less melanin in keratin</h5>
                    <p>Keratin is normally produced by keratinocytes and when these cells die, melanin is retained and gives hair color. The less melanin content, the more gray hair. A person's hair turns white, this also means that there is no melanin in the keratin. That is, the body has also stopped the production of melanin for hair.

                        The lack of melanin pigment causes premature graying of hair.
                        
                        The lack of melanin pigment causes premature graying of hair.
                        </p>
                    <h5>2. Stress</h5>
                    <p>Regular stress, stress can also cause hair color to turn gray sooner. When the body is too stressed, it stimulates the sympathetic nervous system to produce noradrenaline. This is known as a neurotransmitter that causes the melanin to move out of the hair follicle and make the hair gray faster.</p>
                    <h5>3.Smoke</h5>
                    <p>Not only is it bad for your health, but nicotine is also one of the reasons why your hair turns gray faster. Besides nicotine, cigarettes also contain many other harmful chemicals. Smoking for a long time also makes you more susceptible to dangerous diseases such as lung cancer.</p>
                    <h5>4. Heredity</h5>
                    <p>This is also considered a factor that causes premature graying of hair in many people. If in your family there are parents or grandparents with premature graying of hair, there is a high chance that you may also have early gray hair like adults in the family.</p>
                    <h5>5. No proper nutrition</h5>
                    <p>Studies have shown that a proper diet can make your hair healthier. If you don't get enough nutrients, your body will be more susceptible to depression. As a result, the body cannot provide the nutrients it needs to grow hair. Of course, this will make your hair weaker, more prone to breakage and premature graying.

                        In particular, if the body lacks vitamins of groups B, E and D along with many other important minerals, it will also affect your hair. Of course, when the hair lacks nutrients and vitamins, it will quickly turn gray.
                        
                        Besides the specific causes mentioned above, the problem of premature graying hair can also be caused by many different diseases. These can include some problems such as pituitary disorders, thyroid disorders, vitiligo or people with chronic anemia. Or if you abuse antibiotics, use hairdressing chemicals, regularly expose your hair to the sun, ... also make your hair turn gray sooner.</p>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>Baldness is a condition in which hair loss is more than normal and unbalanced, causing many patches of scalp to appear empty, slippery and hair loss on the legs. 
                        The disease occurs in men and women, but men account for a greater proportion
                    </p>
                    <p>Although baldness does not affect health much, it makes many people self-conscious. Baldness in men is easier to recognize than in women through the following common patterns of baldness:</p>
                    <p>M-type: Hair falls out on both sides of the forehead, or what is called a bald forehead, from the temples going deep into the shape of the letter M.</p>
                    <p>U-shaped: Hair falls out from the forehead and reaches the top of the head to form the shape of a U. This type of baldness is also known as a horseshoe shape.</p>
                    <p>O-style: Hair falls out between the top of the head and creates a round shape of various sizes.</p>
                    <p>Baldness originates from the weakening of hair germ cells, leading to hair loss in a greater than normal amount and continuously. And causes of baldness include:</p>
                    <h5>1. Neuroendocrine disorders</h5>
                    <p>Hormonal imbalance is the leading cause of hair loss in both men and women. Besides, male pattern baldness is closely related to post-hormonal hormone.</p>
                    <h5>2. Age</h5>
                    <p>When entering middle age, the body has many changes such as bones and joints are no longer flexible, skin is thinner and hair is also easy to fall. With age, oily skin produces less oil, making hair weak, brittle, and begin to appear gray. This is considered the natural aging process of the body.</p>
                    <h5>3. Due to thyroid problems</h5>
                    <p>An underactive or overactive thyroid both leads to hair loss because thyroid hormone regulates nearly every function in the body including hair growth. Thyroid autoimmune diseases that cause baldness such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease.</p>
                    <h5>4.Stress</h5>
                    <p>Stress, anxiety leads to changes in the hair growth cycle, pushing hair into the resting phase faster than usual.</p>
